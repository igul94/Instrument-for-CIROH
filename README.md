# Submersible Water Level Monitoring Sensor Prototype

## Overview

This repository contains the development and testing of a prototype for novel observation sensors designed to continuously measure changes in water level using pressure loggers. The goal is to collect observations in real-time and facilitate the monitoring of water levels.

## Components

### 1. Submersible Sensor Unit

The submersible sensor unit consists of the following components:

- **Pressure Logger:** Measures water pressure to determine the water level.
- **Data Logger:** Records the collected data.
- **Microcontroller:** Controls the operation of the sensor unit.
- **Power Supply:** Provides the necessary power to the sensor unit.

### 2. Communication Module

To enable real-time data transfer, a communication module is integrated into the system. This includes:

- **Wireless Transmitter:** Facilitates the transmission of data.
- **Antenna:** Enhances the communication range.
- **Data Processing Unit:** Prepares data for transmission.
