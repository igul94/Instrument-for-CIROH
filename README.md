# Submersible Water Level Monitoring Sensor Prototype

## Overview

This repository contains the development and testing of a prototype for novel observation sensors designed to continuously measure changes in water level using pressure loggers. The goal is to collect observations in real-time and facilitate the monitoring of water levels.

## Components
