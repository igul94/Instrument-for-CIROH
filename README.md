# Continuous Monitoring System README

This repository contains the code and documentation for a continuous monitoring system designed for in situ measurements of environmental parameters, specifically focusing on water level and ice thickness. The system utilizes autonomous instruments for precise and continuous data collection in cold regions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

### 1. [Water Level Instrument](#water-level-instrument)

This folder contains all the necessary files and documentation related to the water level monitoring instrument. The system is designed to measure and record the water level in a continuous manner, providing valuable data for understanding water dynamics in cold environments.


### 2. [Ice Thickness Instrument]

This folder encompasses everything related to the ice thickness monitoring instrument. The autonomous system continuously measures the vertical temperature distribution in the near-ice air, ice strata, and under-ice water layer, offering insights into the ice heat balance components during ice-covered periods.
